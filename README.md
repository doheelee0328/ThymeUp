# ThymeUp

## Description

For our La Fosse Academy pair programming project, my partner and I decided to create a cooking recipe website using HTML and CSS. This project allowed us to showcase our skills in web design and development while also challenging ourselves to work collaboratively in a fast-paced environment.

## Planning 

### Crazy 8 method

We used the Crazy 8 method, which involves sketching eight different design concepts in a short amount of time. We set a timer for one minute for each section and moved on to the next one when the time was up. This helped us to quickly generate ideas and choose the best design direction for our website.

### Figma

After using the Crazy 8 method, we used Figma to create wireframes and both low and high fidelity designs of the website. This allowed us to visualize the layout and structure of the website and make any necessary adjustments before starting the coding process. We also used Figma to collaborate and share design ideas, which made the process more efficient and streamlined.


Overall, our planning process was critical in helping us to create a clear vision for our project and collaborate effectively as a team. By using tools like the Crazy 8 method and Figma, we were able to create a cohesive and visually appealing cooking recipe website in just one day of pair programming. We are proud of what we achieved and look forward to applying these skills.
